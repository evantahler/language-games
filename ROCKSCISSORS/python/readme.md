# PYTHON

## Install

1. Install python 3 `brew install python 3`
2. chmod the file `chmod 0766 game.py`

Don't forget to install the VSCode language pack for intellisense!

## Running

Play the game `./game.py`

## Notes

1. Python is loosely typed, like JS
2. Variables do not need to be initialized (no `let` or `const`)
3. underscore-case
4. `main` is special

```
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

5. no 'async' (all calls blocking)
6. Loosely OOO
